In the `validation_step` we report both the loss value and the classification accuracy on a validation batch. We draw an update for every `num_val_batches` batches. This has the benefit of generating the averaged loss and accuracy on the whole validation data. These average numbers are not exactly correct if the last batch contains fewer examples, but we ignore this minor difference to keep the code simple.\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":4,"id":"10753839","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2023-02-10T06:56:57.841815Z","iopub.status.busy":"2023-02-10T06:56:57.841301Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-02-10T06:56:57.846820Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-02-10T06:56:57.846121Z"},"origin_pos":9,"tab":["tensorflow"],"id":"10753839","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1688590864024,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":142,"user":{"displayName":"Dantong Yu","userId":"09243833989926165335"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["class Classifier(d2l.Module):  #@save\n","    \"\"\"The base class of classification models.\"\"\"\n","    def validation_step(self, batch):\n","        Y_hat = self(*batch[:-1])\n","        self.plot('loss', self.loss(Y_hat, batch[-1]), train=False)\n","        self.plot('acc', self.accuracy(Y_hat, batch[-1]), train=False)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"cb3bf761","metadata":{"origin_pos":11,"id":"cb3bf761"},"source":["By default we use a stochastic gradient descent optimizer, operating on minibatches, just as we did in the context of linear regression.\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":5,"id":"7ff5a728","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2023-02-10T06:56:57.849597Z","iopub.status.busy":"2023-02-10T06:56:57.849311Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-02-10T06:56:57.853336Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-02-10T06:56:57.852463Z"},"origin_pos":14,"tab":["tensorflow"],"id":"7ff5a728","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1688590864861,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":140,"user":{"displayName":"Dantong Yu","userId":"09243833989926165335"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["@d2l.add_to_class(d2l.Module)  #@save\n","def configure_optimizers(self):\n","    return tf.keras.optimizers.SGD(self.lr)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"8f99a08c","metadata":{"origin_pos":16,"id":"8f99a08c"},"source":["## Accuracy\n","\n","Given the predicted probability distribution `y_hat`,\n","we typically choose the class with the highest predicted probability\n","whenever we must output a hard prediction.\n","Indeed, many applications require that we make a choice.\n","For instance, Gmail must categorize an email into \"Primary\", \"Social\", \"Updates\", \"Forums\", or \"Spam\".\n","It might estimate probabilities internally,\n","but at the end of the day it has to choose one among the classes.\n","\n","When predictions are consistent with the label class `y`, they are correct.\n","The classification accuracy is the fraction of all predictions that are correct.\n","Although it can be difficult to optimize accuracy directly (it is not differentiable),\n","it is often the performance measure that we care about the most.
